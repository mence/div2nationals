        <div class="span-two-thirds">
          <h2>Division 2 Nationals</h2>
          <p>The AFDA recognises that not all teams are able to qualify for or play at Division 1 Nationals for a variety of reasons (failure to qualify, lack of players, financial reasons, etc). Division 2 Nationals is an effort to boost participation, increase the depth of ultimate frisbee players in Australia and allow all players regardless of team skill level to participate in a strong Nationals-level competition.</p>

          <h3>Is this Nationals?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. For teams that weren't able to qualify for the Division 1 Nationals in Newcastle, this is your AFDA championships and you'll be recognised as AFDA Australian Division 2 National Champions as such.</p>
          
          <h3>How do I qualify?</h3>
          <p>Entry is open to any team that isn't playing Division 1 Nationals as well. Any team that did not qualify for Division 1 Nationals through the Division 1 Regional Championships automatically qualifies for entry into Division 2 Nationals.</p>

          <h3>Can I bring Division 1 players?</h3>
          <p>Exact roster information is currently being determined by the AFDA and we will keep you posted. It is likely that some players who will be playing Division 1 Nationals will be allowed to play Division II Nationals with a different team (such as a development squad or league team), however there may be limits applied to the number and strength of such players.</p>

          <h3>We haven't played much before, is this for us?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. This is intended as a tournament for teams such as yours to work towards. If you're able to form an open or women's team (often league teams will be able to field both an open and a women's team), then get involved!</p>

          <h2>What's Ultimate Frisbee?</h2>
          <p>
          Ultimate frisbee is a non-contact team sport played with a frisbee. It combines elements of netball, touch football, and grid-iron into a fast paced, athletic sport. Competitions usually have co-ed teams, where men and women play together. It is also unique because the sport is self-refereed - due to the 'Spirit of the Game', players are responsible for adhering to and overseeing the rules.
          </p>

          <p>
          During a game, the basic aim is for the team with the frisbee to pass it up the field to others on their team and complete a pass into the endzone. At the same time the defensive team is trying to intercept it or knock it down. If they succeed, they get possession of the frisbee and are trying to score in the other endzone.
          </p>

          <p>
          Ultimate is played on a grass field, narrower than a soccer field. Teams play with seven players on the field each, plus substitutes.
          </p>

          <p>
          Ultimate is played in over 30 countries worldwide, is a sport at the World Games, and has a strong presence in universities and high schools.
          </p>

          <p>
          Ultimate relies upon a Spirit of the Game that places the responsibility for fair play on every player. Players on the field make their own calls when violations occur - there are no referees. If there is disagreement regarding an incident, the frisbee returns to the player who made the last pass and the game resumes. The Spirit of the Game award is a highly coveted award at tournaments.
          </p>

          <p>
          A basic outline of the rules is <a href="http://afda.com/showcontent.php?page=rules_simple" target="_top">here</a>, and the full rules are <a href="http://afda.com/showcontent.php?page=rules_official" target="_top">here</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
          Ultimate is recognised by the Australian Sports Commission.

          <h2>How many teams are coming?</h2>
          <p>We are encouraging teams to apply now if they are anticipating not sending a team to Division 1 Nationals. However, we recognise lots of teams would like to attempt to qualify for Division 1 Nationals and so we will have a better idea of team participation following the Regional Qualification Championships.</p>

          <p>At the moment, we have interest from teams from Brisbane, Canberra, Sydney, Hobart, Melbourne, Geelong, Adelaide & Perth - it should be a great inaugural Div II Nationals and a tough competition!</p>

          <p><u>Please pay a bulk fee which covers your entire team</u> (e.g., if 12 regular and 2 junior players on you team, please pay 12x$65 + 2x$55 = $890). Make sure your team name is in the subject field on your transfer.</p><br>

          <p>Player fees to be paid to the following account:</p><br>

          <p>
            Account Name: Chilly Ultimate Club<br>
            Bank: ANZ<br>
            BSB Number: 013395<br>
            Account Number: 587611483<br>
          </p><br>

          <p>After you have transferred the player fees, please send Martin O'Brien (<a href="mailto:lepetitmartin@hotmail.com">lepetitmartin@hotmail.com</a>) an email detailing how many regular players and how many juniors you have paid for.</p><br>

          <p>Your team rosters should all be finalised (<a href="http://afda.com/rego/showdivision.php?divisionid=2008">http://afda.com/rego/showdivision.php?divisionid=2008</a>). Player numbers have been taken as final from today, so any extras on your team after today may mean less food/snacks/goodies for your team.</p><br>

          <p><b><u>2) Party Venue</u></b></p><br>

          <p>The party venue will be at the <u>Elephant and Wheelbarrow pub, 169 Fitzroy Street, St Kilda</u> (<a href="http://stkilda.elephantandwheelbarrow.com.au/">http://stkilda.elephantandwheelbarrow.com.au/</a>). It is a 10 minute walk from the fields. We have booked the back room from 6-10pm and food will be served there throughout this period (this is covered by your player fee). Please see the attached document for the location of the party venue. Also, if you are still looking for accommodation, there is a backpackers right next to/above the pub.</p><br>

          <p><b><u>3) Game times and Fixtures</u></b></p><br>

          <p>We are finalising the fixtures and will send these out sometime this week. There will likely be two pools of 5, with round robin games taking place on the Saturday and Sunday morning (each team will get one bye). There will then be cross overs, semis, placing games and the final on the Sunday. Games will likely start at 9:30 on Saturday and 9:00am on Sunday. It is likely that two interstate teams will get a bye first thing on Saturday morning. Expect to play 6-7 games over the weekend. The final, presentations and prizes will be finished up by 5pm on Sunday.</p><br>

          <p><b><u>4) Tournament theme/logo</u></b></p><br>

          <p>To celebrate this event we offer you its first logo - the Corroboree frog, an Australian native amphibian living in the Alpine region of Victoria and NSW. This yellow and black frog is a very rare sight with only 200-300 individuals remaining and as such it is now considered critically endangered (it is actually considered Australia's most endangered species). Far from being fragile, this tough critter synthesises its own toxic mucus and lives in rough terrain and survives in the snow at high altitudes. On the logo (see attached picture) you can see our cherished Green and Gold: The yellow of the Corroboree frog is a dark yellow similar to the G&G, and the green represents the lush vegetation where the animal is sometimes found.</p><br>

          <p>We invite you to gather at Division II Nationals as a Corroboree. Corroboree was derived from the Aboriginal word caribberie by the European settlers of Australia. A corroboree is a ceremonial meeting or gathering. In a broader sense, a corroboree can also include sporting events. So what are you waiting for, leap to this - the first Ultimate Corroboree of its kind! Join the other registered teams and experience Division 2 Nationals!</p><br>

          <p><b><u>5) Looking for replacement/extra players or know of players looking for a team?</u></b></p><br>

          <p>If you are looking for extra players, let me know and I will liaise with any captains/players that have contacted me saying that they are looking for a team. Captains, please let me know if you have had to turn away players from your team as your roster is already full - I will put them in touch with captains that need a replacement/extra player or two.</p><br>

          <p>Anything else, please don't hesitate to drop me an email.</p><br>

          <p>Looking forward to seeing you in Melbourne!</p><br>
