          <h2>Division 2 Nationals</h2>
          <p>The AFDA recognises that not all teams are able to qualify for or play at Division 1 Nationals for a variety of reasons (failure to qualify, lack of players, financial reasons, etc). Division 2 Nationals is an effort to boost participation, increase the depth of ultimate frisbee players in Australia and allow all players regardless of team skill level to participate in a strong Nationals-level competition.</p>

          <h3>Is this Nationals?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. For teams that weren't able to qualify for the Division 1 Nationals in Newcastle, this is your AFDA championships and you'll be recognised as AFDA Australian Division 2 National Champions as such.</p>
          
          <h3>How do I qualify?</h3>
          <p>Entry is open to any team that isn't playing Division 1 Nationals as well. Any team that did not qualify for Division 1 Nationals through the Division 1 Regional Championships automatically qualifies for entry into Division 2 Nationals.</p>

          <h3>Can I bring Division 1 players?</h3>
          <p>Exact roster information is currently being determined by the AFDA and we will keep you posted. It is likely that some players who will be playing Division 1 Nationals will be allowed to play Division II Nationals with a different team (such as a development squad or league team), however there may be limits applied to the number and strength of such players.</p>

          <h3>We haven't played much before, is this for us?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. This is intended as a tournament for teams such as yours to work towards. If you're able to form an open or women's team (often league teams will be able to field both an open and a women's team), then get involved!</p>

          <h2>What's Ultimate Frisbee?</h2>
          <p>
          Ultimate frisbee is a non-contact team sport played with a frisbee. It combines elements of netball, touch football, and grid-iron into a fast paced, athletic sport. Competitions usually have co-ed teams, where men and women play together. It is also unique because the sport is self-refereed - due to the 'Spirit of the Game', players are responsible for adhering to and overseeing the rules.
          </p>

          <p>
          During a game, the basic aim is for the team with the frisbee to pass it up the field to others on their team and complete a pass into the endzone. At the same time the defensive team is trying to intercept it or knock it down. If they succeed, they get possession of the frisbee and are trying to score in the other endzone.
          </p>

          <p>
          Ultimate is played on a grass field, narrower than a soccer field. Teams play with seven players on the field each, plus substitutes.
          </p>

          <p>
          Ultimate is played in over 30 countries worldwide, is a sport at the World Games, and has a strong presence in universities and high schools.
          </p>

          <p>
          Ultimate relies upon a Spirit of the Game that places the responsibility for fair play on every player. Players on the field make their own calls when violations occur - there are no referees. If there is disagreement regarding an incident, the frisbee returns to the player who made the last pass and the game resumes. The Spirit of the Game award is a highly coveted award at tournaments.
          </p>

          <p>
          A basic outline of the rules is <a href="http://afda.com/showcontent.php?page=rules_simple" target="_top">here</a>, and the full rules are <a href="http://afda.com/showcontent.php?page=rules_official" target="_top">here</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
          Ultimate is recognised by the Australian Sports Commission.

          <h2>How many teams are coming?</h2>
          <p>We are encouraging teams to apply now if they are anticipating not sending a team to Division 1 Nationals. However, we recognise lots of teams would like to attempt to qualify for Division 1 Nationals and so we will have a better idea of team participation following the Regional Qualification Championships.</p>

          <p>At the moment, we have interest from teams from Brisbane, Canberra, Sydney, Hobart, Melbourne, Geelong, Adelaide & Perth - it should be a great inaugural Div II Nationals and a tough competition!</p>
